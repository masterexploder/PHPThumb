/**
 * PhpThumb Object
 * 
 * This singleton object is essentially a function library that helps with core validation 
 * and loading of the core classes and plugins.  There isn't really any need to access it directly, 
 * unless you're developing a plugin and need to take advantage of any of the functionality contained 
 * within.
 * 
 * If you're not familiar with singleton patterns, here's how you get an instance of this class (since you 
 * can't create one via the new keyword):
 * <code>$pt = PhpThumb::getInstance();</code>
 * 
 * It's that simple!  Outside of that, there's no need to modify anything within this class, unless you're doing 
 * some crazy customization... then knock yourself out! :)

 * @package PhpThumb
