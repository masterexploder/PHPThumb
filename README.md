# PHP Thumb

## NOTICE - from Jarrod Nettles (the forker)
I've made some very radical changes to this library in getting it ready for PHP 5.3. My goals are to get it into a
PSR-0 compliant state and into packagist as such so that it can be easily used in any project. If you intend to use my 
code, bear in mind that most of the documentation is no longer relevant. Instead, look at the examples folder in the project
as I've updated each of them to reflect the new API.

The API is still in flux, as I haven't exactly pinned down where I'd like to take some parts so take anything you
see with a grain of salt. 



PHP Thumb is a light-weight image manipulation library 
aimed at thumbnail generation. It features the ability to 
resize by width, height, and percentage, create custom crops, 
or square crops from the center, and rotate the image. You can 
also easily add custom functionality to the library through plugins. 
It also features the ability to perform multiple manipulations per 
instance (also known as chaining), without the need to save and 
re-initialize the class with every manipulation.

More information and documentation is available at the project's 
homepage: [http://phpthumb.gxdlabs.com](http://phpthumb.gxdlabs.com)

## Documentation / Help

find documentation / help:

- [Documentation](http://wiki.github.com/iselby/PHPThumb/) - Your best friend, the library docs
